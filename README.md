## Description

[![Koding Hackathon](/images/badge.png?raw=true "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)


Our project is a learning game. The principle is similar to Lotto. Players are given 6 cards with names of countries. Each round offers a card with a description of the country(without a title). Players have to guess whether this description to their countries(and to what).
The project consists of 2 parts: user interface and  server. For data exchange used websocket Protocol.
Data cards are taken dynamically from the knowledge base http://wolframalpha.com/ using their API. This scheme allows us to choose almost any theme of the game( animals, plants,languages, programmer languages...)
